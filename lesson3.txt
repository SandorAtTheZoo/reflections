When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

collaboration; remote backup; if you're travelling and would like something accessible from machines other 
than your own

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

other people may make modifications that you don't want to include with your project at that time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork exists on github only and makes a copy of someone else's repository, indicating there is a link.  clones are copies of any existing repository (locally or remote), and branches are done to a repository to track commits separately from the other branches.  Only branches can be pushed or pulled from github.
