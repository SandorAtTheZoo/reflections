When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

collaboration; remote backup; if you're travelling and would like something accessible from machines other 
than your own

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

other people may make modifications that you don't want to include with your project at that time
