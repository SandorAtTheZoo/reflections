When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

collaboration; remote backup; if you're travelling and would like something accessible from machines other 
than your own

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

other people may make modifications that you don't want to include with your project at that time

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork exists on github only and makes a copy of someone else's repository, indicating there is a link.  clones are copies of any existing repository (locally or remote), and branches are done to a repository to track commits separately from the other branches.  Only branches can be pushed or pulled from github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can continue operating without an internet connection for the time being, letting you merge your local changes while not in touch with the remote repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

try to architect the project so that people don't work on the same files.  Work while co-located. Communication could be better in same location, but the cost is more work to try to split the project up into separately workable sections and if merging had to happen, it would be very difficult.  Also, time stamping data and keeping revisions would not be available, making the final product more error prone (without version control)
